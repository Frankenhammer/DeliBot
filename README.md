DeliBot is a Discord bot written in Python 3.6.


## How to run DeliBot on your server:
1. Invite DeliBot - https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=354229190666616844&scope=bot&permissions=0

6. Assign the role to yourself.
7. Run `!install` once.


## Information:
- Only the ones who has the role 'Admin' or 'Moderator' are able to use the commands.
- DeliBot will remove his own reactions after 15 minutes (even thought they don't count, visual effect).
- DeliBot will remove his message after 2 hours (to save performance).

- Only one team reaction will count and be displayed on the embed-message per user BUT if they are coming with multiple others they can react and combine 'One', 'Two' and 'Three' up to six extra players. Note that those 'extra' players will only count towards 'Total :' as they have no name.

- `!install` - Imports necessary emojis to the server and checks if they are valid. 
- `!help` - Displays available commands and other info.
- `!raid <boss> <time> <place*>` - Starts a raid-message with the given information.  
-- `<boss>` - Needs to be one connected name, e.g. *Entei*.  
-- `<time>` - Needs to be one connected time, e.g. *12:00*.  
-- `<place>` - Can be multiple lines, e.g. *Center of town*.
